# Python-Console-App
This is a simple console app I put together to help be learn the basics of python. The idea was to keep track of a list of employees and their pay periods as well as provide the ability to add, remove and list the data

There are 4 main files
  - consoleapp.py: Main entry point of the application. Contains all of the applications functionality
  - entry.py: Class for employee entries / pay periods
  - user.py: Class for the employee's
  - Validator.py: Class that contains methods for validation

What I learned:
  - How to declare variables
  - Creating functions and using the @staticmethod annotation
  - Python specific syntax for dictionaries, lists and tuples
  - Importing and exporting classes and libraries
  - Classes and Object-Oriented programming and the self keyword
  - Error handling
  - Date handling
  - Working with user input

What I'd like to learn:
  - Web-development with python
  - Working with databases
  - Machine learning (Easier said than done haha)
  - Automation and scripting
  - Concurrency and Parallelism
  - Embedded programming
